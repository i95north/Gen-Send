                This tool is a PHP application to generate and send passwords over the web. Created by <a href="http://maffyoo.co.uk">Matthew Brunt</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                No passwords are stored when generated <strong>unless you send them securely to the <a href="send/">Secure-send tool.</a> This is not done unless you click the "Transfer to secure send tool..." button and complete the form.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the expiration date or total number of allowed views has passed, the password will be deleted from the database and no record of it will be left.
            </p>
            <p>
                No information about you is stored in the database. Only what you enter here and the URL to identify this password which is a randomly generated string.
            </p>
            <p>
                Further improvements to the application will be made over time, these changes will be released along with the source code on <a href="<?php echo GEN_SEND_GITHUB_URL; ?>">Github</a> as they're completed.
